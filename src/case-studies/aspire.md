## Goals

Redesign a website initially created to market one product in one vertical to market multiple products in multiple verticals

## Project background

Aspire Software was founded in 2013 with a single product: a cloud-based business management platform for landscape companies. Over the years, it grew by expanding into new verticals and acquiring additional products.

By the time I transitioned to managing website experience, Aspire had four discrete products targeting multiple industries within the broad “field service management” category.

My task was finding a way to incorporate all products and industries on a single Aspire website in a way that met the needs of users, internal stakeholders, and search engines.

Through a series of conversations with marketing leadership and other key players, I was able to create and iterate on a sitemap that addressed these needs.

## Solution

The first step was brainstorming the types of content we needed to have on the website, then exploring strategies to organize that content.

Planning sitemap

We solved the multi-solution, multi vertical challenge by:

- **Separating “industry” and “product”** into their own sections of the site, allowing us to create connections between the two through internal linking
- Creating a **solutions card deck module** and **product comparison module** that can be used to highlight relevant products
- **Nesting product-specific pages** (features, pricing, integrations, etc.) under their relevant product for better user experience
    - e.g., /products/aspire/pricing
- Creating high SEO value, **industry-specific feature pages** that can include one or more relevant products, using a product badge design to show the functionality available for each
- Building a new “**product match form**” experience that allows users to answer three basic questions and be directed to the product that’s right for them

### Industry pages

### High SEO value feature pages

## Sustainable structure

With this new information architecture in place, Aspire is equipped for whatever the future holds—whether that means entering new verticals with existing software (just add a new industry page and link the product there!) or acquiring new solutions (just add a new product page and link to the appropriate industry/ies!).

## Key learnings

Every major website project involves lots of moving pieces and stakeholder requirements. This restructure process was no different and gave me an opportunity to practice leading an initiative with multiple (often seemingly conflicting) goals. The solution I found most helpful was staying in **regular communication** with all stakeholders, investing in **brainstorming** alternative ideas when goals did conflict, using lots of **visual aids** (wireframes, mind maps, etc.), and **clarifying roles** and opportunities for feedback throughout the process.
